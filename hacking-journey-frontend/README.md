# 🛡️ My CTF Journey

Welcome to my personal CTF journey!

This repository documents my deep dive into Capture The Flag challenges, with a special focus on reverse engineering, binary exploitation, basic cryptography, and network-based hacking concepts. It includes detailed write-ups, lessons learned, mistakes made, and how I overcame them (sometimes with a little cheat and a lot of curiosity 😄).

## 📌 What's Inside

- Real-world CTF challenge breakdowns (from picoCTF, VulnHub, etc.)
- Reverse engineering challenges and scripts
- Networking experiments (like ARP poisoning & MITM concepts)
- My learning journey with tools like `nc`, Ettercap, grep, bash, Python
- Tips and tricks for beginners getting into hacking

## 🚀 Why This Exists

After hitting a year-long slump, I reignited my curiosity with a YouTube video and jumped head-first into the world of CTFs. This repo is a reflection of that journey — honest, raw, and still in progress.

## 👤 About Me

I'm Mriganka Das — a passionate coder, reverse engineering enthusiast, and MCA student exploring the world of cybersecurity one flag at a time.
